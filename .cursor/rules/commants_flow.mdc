### 8. Real-World Walk-Through (Illustrative Scenario)

Contract    “Vendor-X Master Services Agreement”             Version v1 – Draft  
Roles       • Alex (Authorised Signatory, Vendor)  
            • Carol (Contract Manager, Legal)  
            • Omar (Contract Observer, Finance)

1  Alex reviews the PDF, highlights the sentence on **Page 5, Paragraph 2**  
   “ … payment shall be remitted within **30 days** of invoice … ”  
   Adds comment: ➊  
   > “Our policy requires 60 days. Please amend.”

   System:  
   • Stores page 5 / para 2 / selected text / comment text  
   • Thread created, status = OPEN  
   • E-mail + in-app toast sent to Carol

2  Carol opens the side panel, clicks the thread, PDF scrolls & highlights text.  
   Carol replies ➋:  
   > “Understood. I can extend to 45 days; 60 exceeds our cash-flow limits.”  
   System notifies Alex; thread remains OPEN.

3  Alex replies ➌:  
   > “45 days is acceptable.”  
   Thread still OPEN.

4  Carol uploads **v2** of the contract with the term changed to “45 days”.  
   System:  
   • Runs AI diff, links thread to v2, sets thread status = RESOLVED  
   • Displays badge “Resolved in v2” next to thread  
   • Locks thread against further replies  
   • Notifies Alex and Omar

5  Contract continues through signature sequence. All parties see the full comment history in the Audit tab even after final signature.

### 9. Acceptance-Test Matrix

| # | Action / Condition | Expected System Reaction |
|---|--------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | AS adds first comment (page N, para M) | Thread created → status OPEN, CM notified |
| 2 | CM replies to thread | Reply recorded, AS notified |
| 3 | Observer attempts to reply | UI blocks action; no DB write |
| 4 | CM marks thread RESOLVED without new version | Thread status changes, participants notified |
| 5 | New contract version uploaded while thread OPEN | Thread auto-carries; status `ADDRESSED_IN_vX`; previous replies immutable |
| 6 | AS tries to add comment after contract status = SIGNED | UI disabled; 409-style error returned |
| 7 | CM deletes a contract version | Not permitted once comments exist; system returns “Action blocked – audit integrity” |
| 8 | Large document (200 pages) — jump to comment | PDF scrolls to correct page; highlight visible within 500 ms |
| 9 | Multiple AS comment same location | Single thread hosts multiple authors; notification fan-out to all participants |
| 10 | System downtime during comment add | Comment queued locally; retries until 201 CREATED; no duplicate records on retry |

These examples and tests complete the comment-system specification and confirm it aligns with every rule in the PRD, tech-stack doc, and assignment brief.
