# 🧠 AI-Augmented Contract Lifecycle Management Platform

## 🚀 Overview

This project is a full-stack, AI-augmented **Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM)** platform inspired by industry leaders like **Ironclad** and **DocuSign CLM**. The platform is designed to assist legal, procurement, and compliance teams in managing the entire lifecycle of enterprise contracts. It emphasizes intelligent automation, ease of use, and scalability.

The project will be developed to fulfill academic assignment requirements, with a strong focus on **evaluation criteria**, ensuring maximum marks upon submission.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Legal and procurement teams deal with thousands of contracts across creation, negotiation, execution, and renewal. Manual processing is inefficient, error-prone, and costly. The aim is to build an intelligent CLM system that streamlines workflows and reduces friction in enterprise contract handling.

## 🎯 Core Features (100% Coverage for Evaluation)

### 📄 1. Contract Management Interface

* ✅ Upload contracts (PDF, Word formats)
* ✅ Maintain version history and view comparisons
* ✅ Set expiry/renewal reminders with notifications (email/real-time)
* ✅ Role-Based Access Control (Admin, Legal, Viewer)
* ✅ Track status (Draft, Review, Signed, Expired)

### 📂 2. Document Organization

* ✅ Tag and categorize contracts
* ✅ Search and filter by metadata (e.g., counterparty, type, dates)
* ✅ Folder-based grouping and management
* ✅ Audit trail for every document action

---

## 🤖 AI-Powered Add-Ons (Highest Evaluation Priority)

### 🧠 Clause Extraction

* Uses NLP to extract key clauses like:

  * Payment Terms
  * Confidentiality
  * Termination

### 🚨 Risk Term Detection

* NLP models highlight high-risk or ambiguous language
* Helps legal teams flag and resolve non-compliant terms

### 🔍 Version Comparison

* AI compares different contract versions
* Auto-generates a summary of changes and differences

### 💬 Contract QA Assistant

* Chat-style assistant to answer user questions like:

  * "When does the agreement expire?"
  * "What are the payment obligations?"

> ⚙️ All AI components will be developed using modern NLP techniques such as transformers, named entity recognition (NER), and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
